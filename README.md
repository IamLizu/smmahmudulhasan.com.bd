Nothing more, nothing less, just a personal webpage.

If chosen to use this repo as example or template, changes need to be done in,

- `src/lib.json` for information on the webpage
- `public/index.html` for html metadata.
- `public/CNAME` to update the custom domain of GitHub Pages. Remove it if homepage is not a custom domain.
- `homepage` in `package.json` for homepage URL.

Optional: If branch name is other than `main` it needs to be changed in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in order to run the workflow.
